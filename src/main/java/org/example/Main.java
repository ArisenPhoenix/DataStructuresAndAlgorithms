        Both problems are available here
        If only problem 2 is important to you then you may comment out problem1
        This was completed using Gradle version
        I am not so well versed in Java as I have only learned enough to complete this assignment
        I am, however, very competent in using JavaScript and Python.
        Which would include these data structures and OOP if you find my methodology using Java is not good enough
        I am able to use the above languages with ease.
        NOTES:
        Since the TreeMap sorts the elements automatically, the binary tree is essentially just a linked list
        since it is not a self-balancing binary tree.
