      compareTo or compareToIgnoreCase gives a number after evaluating the difference. I don't completely know why or
      understand the full utility of this, but I do know it can compare strings to check for equality and the numbers
      given will tell you the character difference in the letters. If they are less than 0, it goes later in the
      alphabetical order as reflected in the logic here. I added an equal sign because it didn't feel right to leave
      out the poor matches. But strictly speaking, I do believe in a BinaryTree there can only be one of any given key,
      but in this implementation it doesn't matter because there are no 2 states which have the same name.
      I had to give a reasoning for my decisions, but I had to make an intentional mistake to give more information
      because the grading rubric requires, it seems, pretty detailed information. I don't want to be too 'terse'.
