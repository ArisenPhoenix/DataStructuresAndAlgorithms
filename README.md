# Data Structures And Algorithms

<p>Notes: I have never taken a Java Course so this may not be my best work.</p>

<h3>This git repository was used because I think it's a more elegant solution than uploading a file, also, I created
multiple files and wanted it to be constructed in that way so the code didn't hurt my eyes - or the readers.</h3>

<p>I do not exactly know how to properly compile a program in Java so this should help to ease any pain points you may
 have with using <b>GitHub</b> to access the program instead.</p>

<p>I read about the differences between gradle and 'the other one' and decided gradle would be better.</p>

<p>There were no configuration requirements, so I think it would actually be easier if you can pull the confuration
from this including version of gradle etc.</p>

<p>Since I do not know how to actually set up a Java Project I ran the Main File as the 'Current File' in the Run
Configuration and also used the IntelliJIdeas IDE to streamline that process for me. 
At first I was using Eclipse and couldn't even get a program to compile and run and just importing a class was a
terrible experience. Needles to say, I am no longer language agnostic and dread working with java ever again.

<p><b>That Should wrap up any confusion that may be had in this small program and any further details specific to the code
will be given in the comments. </b></p>
